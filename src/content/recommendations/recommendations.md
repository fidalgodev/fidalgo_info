### Udemy

- [Visual Studio Code](http://www.google.com) is my editor of choice.
- I use [Hyper JS](http://www.google.com) as my terminal + [Oh my zsh](http://www.google.com) as my Bash. I then have [Pure prompt]() running with ZSH. You can find all my _dot files_ [here]().
- On my editor and terminal I use the [Dank Mono]() font.
